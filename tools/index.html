<p>Every programmer has his toolbox. With my fondness for electronics, I have an additional toolbox to the programming one.</p>
<p>This is the place where I document all of this so that if I am stuck in the Matrix and the Matrix reboots and I lose my memory or I am killed when the droids take over or after the coming-soon-to-a-planet-near-you apocalypse, I don't waste much time in getting the right set of tools ready before I can once again set off to conquer the world.</p>
