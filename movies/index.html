<h2>Stuff I loved watching</h2>
<p>I am a <i>Die Hard</i> movie fan. And like most engineers, I spent a major chunk of my 4 years watching movies. All part of the learning :) </p>
<p>Basically a list of movies I'll love to watch again after my memory has been wiped clean (could happen because of 7 different reasons which will be elaborated later)</p>
