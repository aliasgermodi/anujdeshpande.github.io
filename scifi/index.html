The combined genius of decades and centuries of the most creative and imaginative authors/screenwriters is an excellent cheat sheet if you are into developing such stuff. There should be a compulsory course for CS undergrads, teaching us what's coming and how to prep for it. There actually is a new course at <a href="http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2013/09/syllabus-for-mas-s65-science-fiction-to-science-fabrication/">MIT</a> which does the same. </p>
